## ✨ Features  

### 🔹 Data Understanding  
The dataset includes attributes such as **Date, ID, Gender, Age, Race, Time (AM/PM), Weekday/Weekend, Admin Flag, Department Referral, and Satisfaction Score**. These enable analysis of visitor demographics, hospital engagement, and service usage patterns.  

### 🔹 Data Preprocessing  
- **Normalization & Imputation:** Data was cleaned and structured in **Power Query** to handle missing values and improve clarity.  
- **DAX & Data Modeling:** Created calculated measures and established table relationships for advanced analytics and seamless dashboard integration.  

### 🔹 Visit Trends & Patterns  
- **Daily:** Visits gradually rise mid-month, peak in the final week, and drop on the last day.  
- **Monthly:** Visitor counts increase from April to October, influenced by seasonal factors.  
- **Yearly:** A **5.8% rise** in visits from 2019 to 2020 suggests higher demand or trust in services.  
- **Quarterly:** Q2 & Q3 traffic is **53.9% higher** than Q1 & Q4, aligning with seasonal illness peaks.  

### 🔹 Time-Based Distribution  
- **AM vs PM:** Visits split almost evenly, with a slight **0.6% increase** in the morning.  
- **Day of Week:** Mondays & Wednesdays peak, Fridays record the lowest visits.  
- **Weekday vs Weekend:** Weekday visits are **148.83% higher**, reflecting reduced weekend availability.  

### 🔹 Visitor Wait Time Analysis  
- **Average Wait:** ~35 minutes; **90.9%** wait between 20–60 minutes.  
- **Short Waits:** Only **9.1%** experience waits under 20 minutes → improvement opportunity.  

### 🔹 Demographic Insights  
- **Age Groups:** Balanced distribution, but 75+ age group represents only **5.04%**.  
- **Race:** Majority White & African American; **11.37%** Pacific Islander & Native American combined.  
- **Gender:** Male visitors exceed female by **4.86%**; “Not Specified” at **0.26%**.  

### 🔹 Satisfaction & Departmental Insights  
- **Satisfaction Score:** Average **5/10**, showing scope for service quality improvement.  
- **Department Referrals:** General Practice & Orthopedics account for **30.75%**; non-referred visitors form **58.67%** of traffic.  
- **Admin Flag:** Registered patients: **50.04%**; non-patients: **49.96%**.
